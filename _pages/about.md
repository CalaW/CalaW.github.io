I am a third-year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University (THU), majoring in automation.

My research interests include ***human robot interaction*** and ***medical and healthcare robots***.

I have been working as a research assistant at [Intelligent Robotic Manipulation Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/homepageoflixiang/home) in Tsinghua since 2021, advised by Professor [Xiang Li](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=6EIX-JQAAAAJ).

I am working as a research intern at [Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io) in Carnegie Mellon University this summer, advised by Professor [Zackory Erickson](https://zackory.com).
